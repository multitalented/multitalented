         👩🏻‍💻 Hi, I’m a mechanical engineer that loves coding and wants to move into software development

         I've coded in C++, C#, VBA, MATLAB, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and I've deciphered some python and Java)

         I’m currently learning full-stack web development properly through a bootcamp, 
               so I'm also learning the sexy stuff like: Bootstrap, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, EJS, API's, MongoDB & mongoose, and React
                  
         I have a solid foundation in programming since I love doing it, but I'm learning how to improve my skills as well as industry standards and methods and the f              iner science of data structures and algorithms
                  
         Keep up with my journey as I upload new projects (and check out my older coding work)
         
         Stay tuned for my published personal website that will showcase my favorite coding and creative projects ♥️
