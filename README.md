         üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Hi, I‚Äôm a mechanical engineer that loves coding and wants to move into software development

         I've coded in C++, C#, VBA, MATLAB, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
                  (and I've deciphered some python and Java)

         I‚Äôm currently learning full-stack web development properly through a bootcamp, 
                  so I'm also learning the sexy stuff like:
                  Bootstrap, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, EJS, API's, MongoDB & mongoose, and React
                  
         I have a solid foundation in programming, because I love doing it
                  but I'm learning data structures and algorithms
                  to make up for my lack of academic CS,
                  as well as industry standards and methods
                  since I'm a mechE and all
                  
         **************************************************************************

         Ever since I was a little girl, I loved puzzles and word problems. 
                  I thought engineering made sense to go into as a career, 
                  but I learned later on after finishing my degree that 
                  programming is what I really love because it brings me back
                  to those feelings of tackling a puzzle until the rewarding
                  feeling of figuring it out.

         Every time I get into a programming project or problem,
                  I get that drive to solve until I'm satisfied and understand.
                  
         For these reasons as well as the influence of watching my older brother
                  play video games at a young age, it's probably why I'm also a
                  huge lover of video games and game development

         Keep up with my journey as I upload older code (finally) and new projects!
         
         Stay tuned for my published personal website that will showcase 
                  my favorite coding and creative projects ‚ô•Ô∏è
