👩🏻‍💻 Hi, I’m a mechanical engineer that loves coding and learning software development, comp sci, networking, etc for fun.

I've coded a lot in C++, C#, VBA, MATLAB, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and I've deciphered some python and Java).

I’m currently doing and learning full-stack web development properly through a bootcamp, so I'm also learning how to use stuff like: Bootstrap, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, EJS, API's, MongoDB & mongoose, authentication/security, React...

I have a solid foundation in programming since I love doing it, but I'm learning how to improve my skills as well as learn the industry standards and methods and the finer science of data structures and algorithms

Keep up with my journey as I upload new projects (and check out my older coding work)

Stay tuned for my published personal website that will showcase my CV, favorite coding and creative projects ♥️
